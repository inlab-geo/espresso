You've just come up with a new optimisation algorithm, inversion strategy, or machine learning-based inference framework. Now you want to see how it performs on a real-world problem... 

Espresso (**E**\ arth **s**\ cience **pr**\ oblems for the **e**\ valuation of **s**\ trategies, **s**\ olvers and **o**\ ptimizers) aims to make this as easy as possible. It provides access to a range of exemplars via a standardized Python interface, including domain-expert--curated datasets and corresponding simulation codes. Swapping from one test problem to the next is just one line of code.

Here's a simple illustration:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:
    :class: toggle

    import numpy as np

    # Select the test problem to be used -- change this line to any 
    # other test problem and everything else should still work!
    from espresso import SimpleRegression as test_problem 

    # Create an instance of the test problem class
    tp = test_problem()

    # The test problem provides...
    # ... an initial (null) model vector
    model = tp.starting_model
    # ... the ability to compute simulated data for an arbitrary
    # model vector, and the corresponding jacobian (i.e. derivatives 
    # of data wrt model parameters)
    predictions, G = tp.forward(model, return_jacobian = True)
    # ... a data vector, which matches the output from `tp.forward()`
    residuals = tp.data - predictions 
    # ... and much more!

    # Compute a Gauss-Newton model update
    model += np.linalg.solve(G.T.dot(G), G.T.dot(residuals))
    
    # Compare our result to the answer suggested by Espresso
    print("Our result:", model)
    print("Espresso:", tp.good_model)

    # And let's visualise both to see where the differences are:
    my_fig = tp.plot_model(model)
    espresso_fig = tp.plot_model(tp.good_model)
    data_fig = tp.plot_model(tp.data, tp.forward(model))
