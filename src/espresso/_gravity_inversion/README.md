# Gravity Inversion

This Inversion Test Problem explores the gravitational acceleration of a three-dimensional (example 1) 
and pseude-2D (example 2) density model onto specified receiver locations. In this example, 
only the z-component of the gravityational force 
is calculated. The underlying code itself is capable of calculating all three gravity components 
and six gradiometry components and could be modified quickly if there is the need. 

The gravitational acceleration is calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation: 

$$
    g (r) =- G \frac{ m} {r^2} 
$$

With G being the gravitational constant, r is the distance of the mass
to the receiver and m is the overall mass of the model, which depends on the density $\rho$ and the volume V:

$$
    m = \int_V {\rho(r) dV}
$$

Here, we solve volume integral for the vertical component of $g$ analytically, using the approach by Plouff et al., 1976:

$$
g_z(M,N)=G \rho \sum_{i=1}^2 \sum_{j=1}^2 \sum_{k=1}^2  (-1)^{i+j+k} [tan^{-1} \frac{a_ib_j}{z_k R_{ijk}} - a_i ln(R_{ijk} + b_j) - b_j ln(R_{ijk} + a_i)]
$$

with $R_{ijk}=\sqrt{a_i^2 + b_j^2 + z_k^2}$ and $a_i, b_j, z_k$ being the distances from receiver N to the 
nodes of the current prism M (i.e. grid cell) in x, y, and z directions. It is assumed that $\rho=const.$ within each grid cell.

**Example details:**

 1. **Model:** Density values on a regularly spaced, rectangular grid. Example-model one is a 3D cube of low density (10 $kgm^{-3}$) containing a centrally located high-density cube (1000 $kgm^{-3}$). Example-model two repeats Figure 2 of Last and Kubik, 1983, which means a pseudo-2D model containing zero-density background cells and centrally high-density cells in the shape of a cross (1000 $kgm^{-3}$).

 2. **Returned data:** Gravitational acceleration (vertical component).
    
 3. **Forward:**  The volume integral is solved analytically following the above described approach by Plouff et al., 1976.

<!-- Welcome to your new Espresso example!

To complete this contribution, here are some ideas on what to do next:

- [ ] **Modify [README.md](README.md)**. Replace the title above with your test problem name,
   and document anything you'd like to add for this problem. Some recommended parts
   include:
   - What this test problem is about
   - What you would recommend inversion practitioners to notice
   - etc.
- [ ] **Modify [metadata.yml](metadata.yml)**. As the name suggests, this file contains basic
   information about the problem itself, authors, citations, example information and
   other extra information you'd like to include. It's a yaml file so that we can 
   render some of the information in a more structured manner.
- [ ] **Modify [LICENCE](LICENCE)**. The default one we've used is a 2-clauss BSD licence. 
   Feel free to replace the content with a licence that suits you best.
- [ ] **Write code in [gravity_density.py](gravity_density.py) (and [__init__.py](__init__.py) if
   necessary)**. Some basic functions have been defined in the template - these are the
   standard interface we'd like to enforce in Espresso. You'll see
   clearly some functionalities that are required to implement and others that are
   optional.
- [ ] **Validate and build your contribution locally**. We have seperate scripts for 
   validation and packaging.
   ```console
   $ python espresso_machine/build_package/validate.py         # to validate your contribution
   $ python espresso_machine/build_package/build.py            # to install updated Espresso in your environment
   $ python espresso_machine/build_package/validate_build.py   # to run both of above together
   ```
- [ ] **Delete / comment out these initial instructions**. They are for your own reference
   so feel free to delete them or comment them out once you've finished the above
   checklist.


## How to test your code

> **Note that you cannot test your code directly inside your example subfolder**, due to
> the relative import inside the contribution file. Check the following for details.

***In order to test your code***, use `contrib` as your working directory and import your contribution
in the following ways.

(Python interactive mode)
```python
$ pwd                            # check you are in the right folder
<path-to-espresso>/contrib
$ python
>>> from gravity_density import ExampleName   # import it this way
```

(Creating temporary Python file)
```python
# file contrib/tmp.py            # create tmp file in the right folder
from gravity_density import ExampleName       # import it this way
``` -->
